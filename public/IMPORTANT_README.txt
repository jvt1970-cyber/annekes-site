1. Create a folder named "public" in your project root if it doesn't exist.
2. Place your logo image in this folder.
3. Rename your logo image to "logo.png" (preferred) or "logo.jpg".
4. The application will automatically attempt to load "logo.png" first, then fall back to the stylized text if not found.
