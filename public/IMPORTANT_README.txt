To use your new logo from GitHub:

1. Upload your new logo file as 'logo.png' to the 'public' folder of your GitHub repository.
   (Repo: jvt1970-cyber/annekes-site)
2. The app is configured to fetch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvt1970-cyber/annekes-site/main/public/logo.png
3. If you update the image and don't see changes, you can increment the '?v=...' parameter in components/Logo.tsx to force a refresh.
